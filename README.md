## From the Developer:

This is a Self Project, made on MERN Stack. I did this project while going through a BootCamp, and the Rest was done later on my own. I added and improvised the web app with a lot of features and functionalities.

This is a Full Stack E-commerce Web App just like any other popular E-commerce systems. The only difference is, it is based on Individual Stores.

This is just the Version 1.0.0 of this Project. I have future updates planned with a lot more features.

If you have any suggestions, please feel free to leave the suggestions. Constructive Criticism is always appreciated.

NOTE: This is a demo project. There can be a lot of more features and functionalities that could be added with this.

This project is uploaded to display my work. So there will be no setup instructions provided here.
